## Idea behind the app
It's a fact that if we make daily goals, we become more productive and have a clear vision of what we want to achieve.
The main idea behind this app is to create a platform where developers can write their daily targets and goals.
All the goals are visible to everyone so that they feel motivated after reading what other devs are working on today.
